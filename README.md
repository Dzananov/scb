# User Story
## Goal
Main Goal of the project is to provide a backend to my frontend. The backend is supposed to build up the models and the whole base of the app. App works as a post-picture-blog for horselovers where user can sign up and post pictures with content. Other users can then comment eachothers posts.

* When a post is posted: 
As a user I can edit my post so that I can make changes
As a user I can see my post so that I can manage them
<!-- As a user I can delete my post so that I dont have that post anymore
